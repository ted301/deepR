#new I want to use the latest release of Deep Agents to build Deep Research like the youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geTtqyFnyHA. (If you need the transcript, I can give it to you. Just say the word.)  Deep Agents (https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/tree/master) Deep Agents UI (https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep-agents-ui) and Open Deep Research (where we got the prompt from): https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research

I want to use these tools and framework to build a local deep research platform for myself that can run on MPS (macbook pro, m4 max), runs under conda.  

Please create a root dir at /Users/ted/deepR and a conda environ as deepR-env. Clone or use any of the above frameworks and use python to implement the system.

First, please digest what I need and write a requirements.md first for my review.  Once I approved, you can start design and write an architecture.md for my review.  Once I approved, you can start implementation, task by task; hence, you need to write a tasks.md for my approval.  Once the tasks.md is approved, you can start the implementation.

Along the way, you need to write the checkpoints.md to remember where you are.  Whenever you feel a bit lost, you should check on the checkpoints.md.   You should also write task test scripts periodically to ensure functions, subsystem, and overall system tests. When in doubt, ask me.
